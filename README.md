# Branch-Predictor
The branch predictor implemented in Python is a program that predicts the outcome of conditional statements in a program. The program uses a dataset that contains information about whether the branch was taken or not taken in previous runs of the program. The program uses two types of branch predictors - 1-bit and 2-bit predictors. The 1-bit predictor makes a prediction based on the last outcome of the branch, while the 2-bit predictor takes into account the previous two outcomes. The program calculates the hit rate and miss rate for both predictors and compares them to determine which predictor is more accurate. This information can be used to optimize the program by selecting the best predictor for the given dataset.
